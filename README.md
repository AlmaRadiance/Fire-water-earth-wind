## Project Overview

The project involves creating a JavaScript-based implementation of the game "Rock Paper Scissors". Players will interact with the game through the browser's console. The game will include functions to generate the computer's choice, evaluate the winner of each round, and keep track of the overall score over multiple rounds.

## Project Steps

1. **Setting up the Repository:**
   - Create a new Git repository for the project.
   - Set up the project structure, including HTML and JavaScript files.

2. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create a blank HTML document with an embedded JavaScript file.
   - Include a link to the external JavaScript file for best practices.

3. **Generate Computer's Choice:**
   - Implement a function called `getComputerChoice` that randomly returns 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.

4. **Single Round Function:**
   - Write a function, `playRound`, that takes two parameters - `playerSelection` and `computerSelection`.
   - Determine the winner of the round and return a string declaration.

5. **Game Function:**
   - Create a new function called `game`.
   - Utilize the `playRound` function to play a 5-round game, keeping track of the score.

6. **User Interaction:**
   - Use `prompt()` to get input from the user for each round.

7. **Display Results:**
   - Utilize `console.log()` to display the results of each round and the final winner.

8. **Commit and Version Control:**
   - Commit changes regularly, following best practices for commit messages.
